# The STAR Method for Technical Interviews
Use this template to document your best troubleshooting wins.

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **S**ituation | Set the scene (e.g., "The production database went down at 2 AM"). |
| **T**ask | What was your responsibility? (e.g., "I had to restore service and find the root cause"). |
| **A**ction | **The Technical Part.** What commands did you run? What logs did you read? |
| **R**esult | What was the outcome? How did you ensure it never happens again? |

**Pro-Tip:** Always emphasize the "R" — Hiring managers love to hear about "Automating the fix" or "Updating the documentation."
